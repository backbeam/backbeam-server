Backbeam-server is a compatible implementation of [Backbeam.io](http://backbeam.io), a cloud backend-as-a-service. This project is maintained by the creators of Backbeam and this project will pass similar tests to keep its compatibility.

## Introduction

### Why an Open Source version?

We want our customers to be happy and one of the things that most worry our customers is the vendor-lockin problem. Providing an Open Source implementation solves this problem.

Another important reason is flexibility. Having the opportunity to host your own backbeam-compatible stack you can do many things such as:

- You can install `backbeam-server` in your Continuous Integration server for testing purpouses
- If you are developing a new SDK for Backbeam.io you can test it locally with `backbeam-server`.
- Soon you will be able to dump your data from Backbeam.io to your machines and import the data to a local instance to inspect the data carefully for: machine learning, data mining, reporting, pattern-finding, etc.

### How does it differ from backbeam.io?

- With `backbeam-server` you will have to implement your infrastructure to support scalability, backups, server configuration, security protection, etc.
- backbeam.io supports code versioning itself. With `backbeam-server` you just need to use your favorite version control tool.

## Usage

* Fist step: install `backbeam-server`: `npm install backbeam-server -g`
* Create a directory where you want to start a project.
* Navigate to that directory with the command line.
* Run `backbeam create`. This will generate the basic structure
* Check the database configuration in the generated `config.json` file.
* Check that `mysql` is running
* Run `backbeam start`.
* Browse `http://localhost:3000` in your browser and you will see an example web controller running.
* Browse `http://localhost:3000/admin` in your browser and you will see the admin panel.
* Change controllers, assets, etc. You don't need to restart backbeam, just refresh your browser.
* If you change the data model in `config.json` you need to run: `backbeam migrate` with the server running or you can go to the admin panel to refresh the configuration (`Configuration â†’ Schmea changes` and then `Reload configuration`). That will show you the required SQL commands to update your database schema. You can run them by clicking on `Run SQL commands`.

## What does it support?

Both backbeam.io and `backbeam-server` provide the following features

- Database
- REST API (with Open Source SDKs for iOS, Android and JavaScript)
- Users authentication (email+password, Twitter, Facebook or Google+)
- Push notifications for iOS and Android
- Server-side code execution in JavaScript
- Full-featured MVC web framework
- A real-time API

## Roadmap

- Almost full `bql` support on top of `mysql`
- Implementation of admin panel
- Implementation of all features (users authentication, push notifications,...)
- Finish implementation of `bql` on top of `mysql`
- Full implementation of `bql` on top of `redis`
